EXPERIMENT – 4
# Topic: Sets in Python
# Aim
To study and implement the concept of sets in Python and perform various set operations such as creation of sets, adding and removing elements, union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, and applications of sets in solving real-life problems.
# Theory
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements enclosed within curly braces {}. Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values and support mathematical set operations.
Key Features of Sets
Unordered collection
Does not allow duplicate elements
Mutable (elements can be added or removed)
Cannot be accessed using indexing
Can store elements of different data types
Set Operations
Union (|) – Combines elements of two sets
Intersection (&) – Common elements between sets
Difference (-) – Elements present in one set but not the other
Symmetric Difference (^) – Elements present in either set but not in both
Frozenset
A frozenset is an immutable version of a set. Once created, elements cannot be added or removed.
# Algorithms

# conclusion 
In this experiment, the concept of sets in Python was successfully implemented. Various operations such as adding and removing elements, union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference were performed. The use of sets helped in eliminating duplicate values and solving real-world problems like finding unique participants, common subjects, and absent students. Thus, sets are an efficient and powerful data structure in Python.
